# MSH (Micro-Service Helper)

## Idea

The idea behind MSH is a set of tools mimicking a framework in decoupling manner (Micro-Framework).

It is written to be used in Typescript/Node.js projects (and can also be used in web projects)

## List of tools

- [msh-util](https://github.com/beecode-rs/msh-util) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@beecode/msh-util) - useful functions
- [msh-node-session](https://github.com/beecode-rs/msh-node-session) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@beecode/msh-node-session) - cls-hooked wrapper
- [msh-error](https://github.com/beecode-rs/msh-error) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@beecode/msh-error) - error collection
- [msh-logger](https://github.com/beecode-rs/msh-logger) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@beecode/msh-logger) - log abstraction
- [msh-env](https://github.com/beecode-rs/msh-env) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@beecode/msh-env) - env variable extraction with validation
- [msh-app-boot](https://github.com/beecode-rs/msh-app-boot) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@beecode/msh-app-boot) - app initialization abstraction, app creation/destruction flow control
- [msh-cli](https://github.com/beecode-rs/msh-cli) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@beecode/msh-cli) - helps with managing multi repo project
